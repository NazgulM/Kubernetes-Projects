3 Ubuntu 16.04 nodes with 2(v)CPUs, 4GB of memory and with swap disabled
Make sure swap is disabled by running swapoff -a and removing any swap entry in /etc/fstab. You must be able to access the node using SSH. As this is a multi-node cluster, the required ports need to be opened before proceeding.
swapoff -a
apt install firewalld -y
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=6443/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
